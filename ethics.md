dpa’s journalists are free and independent when it comes to their reporting. We are committed to truth and facts, and not to political parties, religious or cultural beliefs, industry or any other interest groups.

Furthermore, dpa’s clients are heterogeneous, which makes it impossible to align with various interest groups. It is a fundamental tenant of journalism that we tell good stories and provide facts, but allow readers to draw their own conclusions.

For dpa, trust and truth are of utmost importance. Our business model is based on absolute reliability. This is why there is no job more important that sifting facts from the daily flood of information to ensure lies and propaganda are not disseminated to our customers. In addition to a vetted group of correspondents, dpa has a system of controls to ensure errors are not transmitted through our products. No story is ever published without having been seen by at least two editors and if necessary, we choose accuracy over speed. 

For examples of how we work, please refer to the section [how we work](https://www.dpa.com/en/company/how-we-work/#from-events-to-news) on our corporate website.
