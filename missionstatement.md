dpa is Germanyâ€™s oldest and largest news agency; we are an independent community of editors for the German media. We, that is more than 1,000 journalists, report in nearly every country in the world.

We work in 60 German bureaus, fact checking, researching, interviewing sources, following developments and analyzing from more than 100 different cities around the world. All to create comprehensive news stories, features and backgrounds. No story is ever published without having been seen by at least two editors and if necessary, we choose accuracy over speed.

Trust and truth are of utmost importance. Our business model is based on absolute reliability. In addition to a vetted group of correspondents, dpa has a system of controls to ensure errors are prevented from being transmitted through our products, and swiftly corrected whenever these controls fail.
