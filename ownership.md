The German Press Agency dpa is a private limited liability company under German law (GmbH) with around 190 German shareholders (newspaper and magazine publication houses, publishers, broadcasting cooporations and media groups).

No shareholder may hold up more than 1.5 per cent of its total capital, with a maximum of 25 % of share capital being held by broadcasters. This ensures that no single shareholder can exert a dominating influence on the company.

In 2011, dpa's core company turnover (i.e. excluding subsidiaries and shares) amounted to 94 million Euros. The operating principles of the company are defined by the shareholders at their general meetings.
