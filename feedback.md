In most of the cases, our material is edited, complemented and redacted by our customers, and we provide them with a host of feedback mechanisms, including direct telephone lines and emails of our editors and writers and a feedback dialog function on the news website available exclusively to them. We invite news consumers to channel feedback through our customer's media outlets, because it is part of our operating principles that the relationship to news consumers is our customers to cultivate.

Nonwithstanding, you may of course contact us directly by the means listed [on our corporate website](https://www.dpa.com/en/contact/editorial-desks/) and contact our staff individually by the contact points provided in articles who carry their author's names.
