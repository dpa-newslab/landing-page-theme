Of course we make mistakes. dpa is a company comprised of real people and there is always the possibility of misunderstandings, misperceptions or simple spelling errors. But even the smallest errors are important for dpaâ€™s credibility, which is why we address them openly, honestly and in the most transparent fashion possible.

Please find the details, as well as examples of past mistakes and their corrections in the section "Does dpa make mistakes?" of [dpa's corporate website](https://www.dpa.com/en/company/faq/).
