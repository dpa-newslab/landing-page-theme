Of course we make mistakes. dpa is a company comprised of real people and there is always the possibility of misunderstandings, misperceptions or simple spelling errors. But even the smallest errors are important for dpa’s credibility, which is why we address them openly, honestly and in the most transparent fashion possible.

When an error occurs, reports are sent out a second time with a label reading “rectification.”  Customers will find the correction is written out twice – once above the text headline in an abbreviated fashion and then again below the text where the error is explained in detail. These corrections are then disseminated through the usual dpa channels with the same priority as the original text. If there is a mistake during a breaking news event, it is corrected with the same priority: colored in red with an exclamation point. Exactly the same as the breaking news item.

dpa mistakes happen about ten times a day. It may sound like a lot, but dpa distributes more than 800 reports a day in the German wire alone. We pride ourselves in being very thorough when it comes to fact checking and providing reliable content and most corrections do not alter the substance of the report. Most often it is a small mistake that was overlooked, like a spelling mistake or correcting the age of a person.

Please find examples of mistakes and corrections on the section "Does dpa make mistakes?" of [dpa's corporate website](https://www.dpa.com/en/company/faq/).
